# Challenges_CATAAS


This repo contains 2 folders corresponding to two different server apps:

- CAT API PROXY
- CAT AS A SERVICE CRUD

All you need is Docker & docker compose (please use Docker Desktop to make it easier).
And postman for testing (check out the postman collections present on this repo).

Important: check out the instructions file (PDF) present in this repo for more details about the projects (how to run, some guidelines etc).
